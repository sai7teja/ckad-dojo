| **Points** | 5 |
| **CNCF Domain** | Application Design and Build |
| **CNCF Weight** | 20% |
| **Namespace** | - |
| **Resources** | Docker Image |

### Task

There is a Dockerfile located at `./exam/course/1/Dockerfile`.
Build a container image using this Dockerfile and tag it as `localhost:5000/fujin-api:v2`.
Push the built image to the local registry at `localhost:5000`.

## Question 2 | Sidecar Logging Container

|                          |                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Points** | 6 |
| **CNCF Domain** | Application Design and Build |
| **CNCF Weight** | 20% |
| **Namespace** | `gale` |
| **Resources** | Pod |

### Task

An application is running in a pod named `wind-logger` in the `gale` namespace. It generates logs in a format that is not easily parsable by our central logging system.
Modify the pod to include an adapter container using the image `busybox:1.31.1`.
The main container `app` writes logs to `/var/log/wind.log`. The adapter container should mount the same volume, tail the log file, and output each line prepended with `[WIND-LOG]` to stdout using `tail -f /var/log/wind.log | sed 's/^/[WIND-LOG] /'`.
Make sure the adapter container is named `adapter` and both containers share a volume named `logs` mounted at `/var/log`. The pod is already created but might need to be replaced.

### Task

Create a Job named `storm-processor` in the `breeze` namespace.
The Job should use the `busybox:1.31.1` image and execute the command: `sh -c 'sleep 2; echo "Processing storm data"'`.
Configure the Job to run a total of `6` successful completions, with `3` pods running in parallel.

### Task

There is a deployment named `tempest-app` in the `tempest` namespace.
Extract its pod template and create a standalone Pod named `tempest-debug` in the `tempest` namespace.
The `tempest-debug` Pod should have the exact same container specifications (image, ports, env vars) as the deployment's pod template, but change the container's command to `['sleep', '3600']`.
Save the YAML definition used to create this Pod at `./exam/course/4/pod.yaml`.

Create a Pod named `secret-reader` in the `gale` namespace using image `alpine:3.14` and command `sleep 3600`.
Mount the Secret into the pod such that only the file `password.txt` appears at `/etc/secrets/password.txt` without deleting any other files that might exist in `/etc/secrets` (use `subPath`).
